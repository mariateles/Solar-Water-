In my Marketing Management class at university, I spearheaded a groundbreaking project centered around the development of a solar-powered water bottle tailored for outdoor enthusiasts. Our innovation, named SolarWater, aimed to provide a seamless solution for adventurers seeking purified drinking water while traversing natural landscapes. Through meticulous competitor analysis and strategic marketing research, we crafted a product that not only ensures consumer safety but also champions eco-friendliness. Our journey involved extensive exploration of various features and market entry strategies, culminating in a comprehensive plan to bring SolarWater to the market.
